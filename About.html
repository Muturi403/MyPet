    <p>Owning a pet is one of the best thing a human has, but not all  <br>
         pets get homes, others are left as stray pets eg:<strong>Dogs, Cats</strong> and <strong>animals</strong>.
         <br>How does that make you feel? Well no need to worry, here is a solution for you. <br>
          We offer services for both pet owners and stray pets, the fantastic part is that we <br> give homes to stray pets and groom them for adoption </strong>
